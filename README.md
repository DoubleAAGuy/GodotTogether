## Showcase
TODO

## Is it possible to host a project without opening ports?
The server is hosted on your machine, not some centralized network, so you need to either open ports in your router, host the server on a VPS or use a virtual network such as [Zerotier](https://zerotier.com).

So yes, it is possible with a virtual network. Don't worry it's very easy.
