## FAQ

### Why wasn't it published earlier?
Due to the high possibility of using this plugin to remotely execute code, I wanted it to be as secure as possible before publishing.
I also wanted it to be usable enough. 
However due to feedback I've decided to make it public despite not being ready.

I must admit that I was being lazy and unmotivated to work on it.

I also got a bit too excited for something that was just an experiment. 

### Is it possible to host a project without opening ports?
The server is hosted on your machine, not some centralized network, so you need to either open ports in your router, host the server on a VPS or use a virtual network such as [Zerotier](https://zerotier.com).

So yes, it is possible with a virtual network. Don't worry it's very easy.
